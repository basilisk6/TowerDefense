### Gameplay

Tower Defense is an open map-maze builder game. The goal is to succesfully eliminate the creeps spawning from the green area and preventing them for reaching the red area. To do such thing, you must build the towers by left-clicking on the map field, then the tower will be loaded and ready. The creep can't pass through the tower neither attack it, so he will just go other route if he encounters it. By building more towers you ensure that creeps will be killed successfully. Be carefull, when building towers you msut ensure that you dont block at least one path for creeps, that will cause that the game won't start. Once you made your strategy choices, placed the towers, press the key `r` and the gameplay will start.
